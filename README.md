This project was created with create-react-app, using the template for typescript.

At present, this is simply a web-based mag feeding guide for Phantasy Star Online Ep. 1+2.

Soon, I will be adding a 'mag feed simulator' that will implement the following:

- [] Select a mag from a dropdown list
- [] Enter the mag's current stat levels / overall level
- [x] Feed the mag
- [] Evolve the mag
- [] Log what you've fed it (for printing / saving as a txtfile)

Stay tuned.
